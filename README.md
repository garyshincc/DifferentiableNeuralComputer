# DifferentiableNeuralComputer


Differentiable Neural Computer following Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory, Graves et al.
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101/

PyTorch implementation of
* External Memory + Batch Pairwise Cosine Similarity module (Attention for read + write)
* Temporal Link Matrix (When + Where)
* Controller Module (interaction with memory)
* Simple version of Memory network

Task: copy task to remember a sequence of random inputs and reproduce.
